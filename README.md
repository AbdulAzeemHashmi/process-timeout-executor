# Operating Systems Assignment

A C-based process runner with a Bash log analyzer, built for an Operating Systems course assignment. The runner reads shell commands from a file, executes each in a child process with a configurable timeout, and records the result. The analyzer parses the output log and produces a summary report.

## Features

- Executes commands from a plain-text file, one per line
- Enforces a per-command timeout using `SIGTERM` followed by `SIGKILL`
- Supports quoted arguments (e.g., `echo "Hello World"`) via a custom parser
- Two operating modes: **lenient** (continue on failure) and **strict** (abort on first failure)
- Non-blocking child monitoring with `waitpid(WNOHANG)` for accurate time tracking
- Bash analyzer script with success rate grading (`GOOD`, `AVERAGE`, `POOR`)

## Build Instructions

Compile with GCC using warnings and optimization:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 runner.c -o runner
```

---

## Usage

### Runner

```bash
./runner <tasks_file> <timeout_seconds> <mode>
```

| Argument          | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `tasks_file`      | Path to the file containing commands to run      |
| `timeout_seconds` | Max seconds allowed per command before killing   |
| `mode`            | `lenient` to continue on errors, `strict` to abort |

**Lenient mode** (saves output to a log file):

```bash
./runner tasks.txt 5 lenient > my_run.log
```

**Strict mode** (aborts on the first failure):

```bash
./runner tasks.txt 5 strict
```

### Log Analyzer

```bash
chmod +x analyze.sh
./analyze.sh my_run.log
```

Or run directly without the permission step:

```bash
bash analyze.sh my_run.log
```

For verbose debugging:

```bash
bash -x analyze.sh my_run.log
```

---

## Output Format

Each executed command produces a line in this format:

```
[INDEX] CMD="<command>" => RESULT=<result> TIME=<seconds>
```

Where `RESULT` is one of:

| Result         | Meaning                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `EXIT(0)`      | Command succeeded                            |
| `EXIT(N)`      | Command exited with non-zero code N          |
| `TIMEOUT`      | Command exceeded the timeout limit           |
| `SIGNAL(N)`    | Command was killed by signal N               |

At the end (lenient mode only), a summary line is printed:

```
SUMMARY total=N ok=N fail=N timeout=N signaled=N
```

### Analyzer Report

```
REPORT
total=N ok=N
nonzero=N
timeout=N
signaled=N
slowest=[INDEX] time=X.XX cmd="<command>"
STATUS=GOOD | AVERAGE | POOR
```

Status thresholds: `GOOD` if success rate is 80% or above, `AVERAGE` if 50% or above, `POOR` otherwise.

## Example

Given `tasks.txt`:

```
ls -l
sleep 2
echo "Hello World"
```

Run:

```bash
./runner tasks.txt 5 lenient > my_run.log
./analyze.sh my_run.log
```

Sample `my_run.log`:

```
[1] CMD="ls -l" => RESULT=EXIT(0) TIME=0.01
[2] CMD="sleep 2" => RESULT=EXIT(0) TIME=2.02
[3] CMD="echo "Hello World"" => RESULT=EXIT(0) TIME=0.05
SUMMARY total=3 ok=3 fail=0 timeout=0 signaled=0
```

Sample analyzer output:

```
REPORT
total=3 ok=3
nonzero=0
timeout=0
signaled=0
slowest=[2] time=2.02 cmd="sleep 2"
STATUS=GOOD
```

## Design Notes

**Fork-Exec model:** Each command is executed in a child process created with `fork()`. The child replaces its image using `execvp()`, keeping the parent process clean and isolated.

**Non-blocking monitoring:** The parent uses `waitpid()` with `WNOHANG` inside a polling loop alongside `gettimeofday()` for precise elapsed time measurement without blocking.

**Graceful termination:** On timeout, the parent sends `SIGTERM` first. If the process does not exit within 1 second, `SIGKILL` is sent to guarantee cleanup.

**Quoted argument parsing:** A custom `parse_line()` function handles double-quoted strings as single arguments, going beyond what basic `strtok` splitting can do.

**Input filtering:** Empty lines and lines with leading whitespace are silently skipped to avoid unnecessary fork calls.
